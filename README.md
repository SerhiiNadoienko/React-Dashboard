# React-Dashboard

## **Description**

A dashboard with a big amount of built-in functions. Suitable for personal and corporate usage.

The [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework was used for styling
The [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/) library was used to create graphs and metrics

**Functionality**

- Dynamic changing of color
- Adaptation for all devices
- Several types of interactive graphs and metrics
- Implemented a kanban TaskBoard
- Implemented a component for keeping records of employees and customers. There is a possibility of editing, deleting, pagination.

### **Details**

- It was decided to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to reduce the time for writing styles and creating a unique class for each element.For a large application, I would not use it, because in my opinion it is much more reliable to assign a className to an element in order to understand which block of code it belongs to.
- I used [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/) to develop graphs because it's fast, reliable and beautiful.
- All application logic is written in a separate file using **React context**.
- For navigation I used the **React Router Dom v6**.
- All components can be conveniently reused in any part of the application, you only need to transfer the necessary props.
